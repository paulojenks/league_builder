## League Builder
The League Builder program reads data from a CSV file.  It stores the data and is then iterated through to assign players to 3 teams evenly based on each team having the same number of experienced/inexperienced players.  The program outputs a text file (teams.txt) that contains the league roster listing the team name and each player including the player's information: name, soccer experience and guardian's names.  Another .txt file is created for each player that is a welcome letter with practice information.
